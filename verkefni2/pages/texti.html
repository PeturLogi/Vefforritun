    <h2>Chapter I — How many kinds of principalities there are, and by what means they are acquired</h2>
    <p>
        All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have
        been and are either republics or principalities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long
        established; or they are new.
        <br />
        <br />
        The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or
        they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the
        prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of
        the King of Spain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a 
        prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of 
        the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter II — Concerning hereditary principalities</h2>
    <p>
            I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in
            another place I have written of them at length, and will address 
            myself only to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the 
            order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to 
            be ruled and preserved.
            <br />
            <br />
            I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary 
            states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince,
            than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the 
            customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances
             as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain 
             himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some 
             extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so 
             deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the 
             usurper, he will regain it.
             <br />
             <br />
             We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could 
             not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor 
             those of Pope Julius in '10, unless he had been long 
             established in his dominions. For the hereditary prince has 
             less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that 
             he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him 
             to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will 
             be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and 
             duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for 
             change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for 
             another.
